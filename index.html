                    <p>The Broken Beach Gym was founded in June 2022, just months before the catastrophic Broken Beach Earthquake set real estate
                    development back a generation. We have decided to embrace our permanent "Under Repairs" status as part of the
                    exciting theme of our official Pokemon Trainers League experience. Watch your step!
